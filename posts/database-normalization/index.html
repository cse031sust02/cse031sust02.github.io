  <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Database normalization is the process of organizing a relational database to reduce data redundancy (duplicate data) and improve data integrity. The concept of Normalization was introduced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd">Edgar F. Codd</a>.</p>
<p>Normalization is part of a successful database design. It makes a Relation or Table free from insert/update/delete anomalies and saves space by removing duplicate data.</p>
<h2 id="normal-forms-">Normal Forms :</h2>
<p>Theory of Data Normalization is still being developed further. There are discussions even on 6th Normal Form. But usually we call a relational database as &ldquo;normalized&rdquo; if it meets third normal form. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#cite_ref-Codd1970_4-0">(src)</a></p>
<h3 id="first-normal-form">First Normal Form</h3>
<p>Once a table is in first normal form, it is easier to search, filter, and sort information from that table.</p>
<p>The rules for first normal form :</p>
<ul>
<li>End row should contain a primary key to uniquely identify that row. The primary key can be a single column or combination of multiple columns.</li>
<li>Each column should contains atomic value (can not be subdivided). i.e., &ldquo;red, green&rdquo; is not acceptable.</li>
<li>Each column should contains values that are same type (i.e., do not put &lsquo;address&rsquo; in &lsquo;phone&rsquo; column)</li>
<li>There are no repeating groups of columns (i.e., do not have columns like Phone1, Phone2, and Phone3)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="second-normal-form">Second Normal Form</h3>
<p>The rules for second normal form :</p>
<ul>
<li>The database must meet all the requirements of the 1NF.</li>
<li>All the non-key columns depend on the tableâ€™s primary key.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="third-normal-form">Third Normal Form</h3>
<p>The rules for third nomal form :</p>
<ul>
<li>The database must meet all the requirements of the 2NF.</li>
<li>All the columns of the table are not transitively dependent on the primary key.</li>
</ul>
<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrYLYV7WSHM">video</a> is very helpful to understand all the normal forms with example.</p>
