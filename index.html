  What is Docker? Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package — OpenSource.com, What is Docker?
Docker enables us to separate our applications from our infrastructure. So we developers can focus on writing code without worrying about the system it will ultimately run on.

  Intro The authentication that comes with Django is good enough for most common cases. Django also allows us to customize authentication if the defaults don&rsquo;t match our requirements.
There are multiple approaches we can take to customize the Django authentication system. We can extend the default User model, or substitute a completely customized model.
 Extending the default User model There are two ways to extend the default User model without substituting our own model.

  PostgreSQL is a object-relational database management system. It is most advanced open soruce relational database.
Taking backups using pg_dump : pg_dump is a utility for backing up a PostgreSQL database.
We can extract the database in script file or archive file formats :
 Script Files : These are plain-text files containing the SQL commands. We can restore data from these script files using psql. Archive Files : The archive files allow pg_restore to rebuild the database.

  Intro MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database. It is one of the most powerful NoSQL systems and databases around, today.
Key Features : Here is the key features of MongoDB :
 MongoDB is free to use. MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time The document model maps to the objects in your application code, making data easy to work with Ad hoc queries, indexing, and real time aggregation provide powerful ways to access and analyze your data MongoDB is a distributed database at its core, so high availability, horizontal scaling, and geographic distribution are built in and easy to use   source: MongoDB Website

  MongoDB comes with two commands that allow us to quickly backupand restore to our running MongoDB instances. In order to take backups, we can use the mongodump command which creates BSON dump files. And to restore those dump, we can use the mongorestore command.
 Taking Backups - all databases $ mongodump - single database $ mongodump --db &lt;DATABASE&gt; - single collection $ mongodump --db &lt;DATABASE&gt; --collection &lt;COLLECTION&gt; - from remote host $ mongodump --host &lt;HOST&gt;:&lt;PORT&gt; --username &lt;USERNAME&gt; --password &lt;USERNAME&gt; --db &lt;DATABASE&gt; - using uri $ mongodump --uri=&quot;&lt;CONNECTION STRING&gt;&quot; *if your local mongodump is having lower version than remote mongodb and the above command does not work, try adding the --forceTableScan option.

  Intro AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps us securely control access to AWS resources. We can control authentication (who can signed in) and authorization (who has permissions to use resources) using IAM. When we create an AWS account, we get a root user which has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account. It is recommended that we do not use the root account regularly, instead we should create IAM users to access the AWS services and resources frequently.

  Intro This is a very simple guide for first-timers to making open source contributions. I guess that you already have a GitHub account and know basic git commands.
 Steps for Contributing Fork First, we need to choose a project we want to contribute. Then we will fork the project to our github account.
Clone Now, we need to clone the project to our machine from our fork.
$ git clone &lt;url&gt; Syncing the fork We should keep our fork up-to-date with the main(aka upstream) repository.

  By default, phpMyAdmin allows us to connect to local MySQL server only. But we may need to access multiple database servers from our single phpMyAdmin. It&rsquo;s such an easy job. For each new server, we will just need to create a new config file (with .php extension) in /etc/phpmyadmin/conf.d directory.
lets create a new server
sudo nano /etc/phpmyadmin/conf.d/second-server.php &lt;?php $cfg['Servers'][2]['verbose'] = 'Database Server #2'; $cfg['Servers'][2]['host'] = 'DB_HOST'; $cfg['Servers'][2]['user'] = 'DB_USERNAME'; $cfg['Servers'][2]['password'] = 'DB_PASSWORD'; That&rsquo;s it!

  Intro Database normalization is the process of organizing a relational database to reduce data redundancy (duplicate data) and improve data integrity. The concept of Normalization was introduced by Edgar F. Codd.
Normalization is part of a successful database design. It makes a Relation or Table free from insert/update/delete anomalies and saves space by removing duplicate data.
 Normal Forms Theory of Data Normalization is still being developed further. There are discussions even on 6th Normal Form.

A single use case diagram captures a particular functionality of a system. So to model the entire system, a few major use cases are used. A Use case diagram should not go deep into the details of use cases rather it should be easily understood by any non-technical person.

Swagger Specification? The Swagger Specification (currently known as the OpenAPI specification) is a powerful definition format to describe RESTful APIs. The specification creates a RESTful interface for easily developing and consuming an API by effectively mapping all the resources and operations associated with it.

  We can think of Server Blocks as specifications for individual web sites. Server blocks are the NGINX equivalent of Apache&rsquo;s virtual hosts. So in order to host our websites on Nginx server, we need to understand the directives and settings that make up the server block.
Here is a sample server block configuration :
server { listen 80; server_name _; location / { root /usr/share/nginx/html; index index.html index.htm; } error_page 404 /404.

  What is Nginx Nginx is a high performance web server which is lightweight, free and open-source. It can be used as a standalone web server (like Apache) or as a reverse proxy (serve in front of the web servers). Nginx is also used as mail proxy server, load balancer and HTTP cache.
Why use Nginx? There are other web servers such as Apache, IIS etc. So what makes Nginx special?

  Intro WebSocket is a protocol (like HTTP) which defines how two parties can communicate. It is a technique for two-way communication over one (TCP) socket.
A very good intro is written in this post
 How It Works WebSockets provide a persistent connection between a client and server.
Once a WebSocket connection is established the connection stays open until the client or server decides to close this connection. With this open connection, the client or server can send messages to each other at any given time.

  What is JSON? JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
Douglas Crockford originally specified the JSON format in the early 2000s. Altohugh it derives from JavaScript, but as of 2017 many programming languages include code to generate and parse JSON-format data.
JSON filenames use the extension .json.
The official internet media type for JSON is &lsquo;application/json&rsquo;

 lightweight data-interchange format. language independent &ldquo;self-describing&rdquo; and easy to understand by both humans (to understand) and machines (to parse and generate).
