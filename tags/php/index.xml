      <description>What is Composer?  Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.
source : getcomposer.org
 Why Use Composer? Suppose, we want to use a mail library for our PHP project, let&amp;rsquo;s say PHPMailer. We would normally download the PHPMailer library and put it on our project&amp;rsquo;s folder. But, PHPMailer depends on some other libraries too.</description>
